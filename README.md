# UR-Robot-AR-Twins

**Purpose:** To share ideas about using augmented reality to facilitate the integration of industrial robots.

**Summary:** A a novel approach to integrating industrial robots in a production facility, using augmented reality digital twins. The AR digital twins depicted herein are intended to simplify the process of spatially planning a workstation, display real-time performance metrics for a robot in operation, as well as provide an intuitive user interface for creating basic robotic programs. This digital twin package is enabled by PTC's smart manufacturing software suite and was created specifically for Universal Robots' collaborative robot family.

## Project Background

### Introduction

The incorporation of automation technology into a production facility is often an arduous and capital-intensive process that requires considerable specialized expertise. Many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are struggling to integrate robots and/or other automation systems into their facilities due to the overwhelming capital expenses and technical knowledge required during setup. Even after the automation systems have been assembled, robots still must be frequently re-programmed to accommodate high-mix, low-volume products which are characteristic of most SMEs. Thus, the true cost of implementing robots becomes prohibitively high for these types of companies. A new and more intuitive approach to assist SMEs in their endeavor to automate their facilities is therefore necessary.

### What is a Digital Twin?

Industry 4.0 – often called the fourth industrial revolution – represents the marriage of physical production facilities with digital operational technologies. This new stage of industrial activity aims to provide digital solutions to address the problems the manufacturing sector faces. One of the most ubiquitous Industry 4.0 solutions is the digital twin.

Digital twins are defined as “a digital representation of an active, unique product or service or production system that is characterized by certain properties or conditions used in order to analyze, understand and improve the product, product service system, or production”. Digital twins come in many forms and can take any shape, from simple performance-monitoring dashboards, to data-rich simulation models, to immersive virtual-reality environments. The classification of digital twin used in any given situation should be determined based on the results and the level of immersion desired.

### Project Objective

This repository presents a comprehensive digital twin package, based in augmented-reality (AR), that will facilitate SMEs in incorporating industrial robots into their production areas. The digital twins described hereafter can be used in existing factories with no extra costs and require little-to-no prior skill in robot programming. They will help SMEs confidently determine their needs with the robots before making the expensive purchase, as well as assist employees with creating robotic movement paths and monitoring real-time robot performance.
