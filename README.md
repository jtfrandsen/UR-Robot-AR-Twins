# UR-Robot-AR-Twins

**Purpose:** To share ideas about using augmented reality to facilitate the integration of industrial robots.

**Summary:** A a novel approach to integrating industrial robots in a production facility, using augmented reality digital twins. The AR digital twins depicted herein are intended to simplify the process of spatially planning a workstation, display real-time performance metrics for a robot in operation, as well as provide an intuitive user interface for creating basic robotic programs. This digital twin package is enabled by PTC's smart manufacturing software suite and was created specifically for Universal Robots' collaborative robot family.
